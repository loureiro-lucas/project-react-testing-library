# Project React Testing Library! üöÄ

This is the fifth project of Trybe course Front-end module.
The objective was to practice my **react testing skills** using `React testing library`, `Mocks` and `userEvent`. For that,I had to achieve **100% coverage** of the use cases generated by `stryker`.

`Requirements:`

##### - 1 - Test `<App.js />` component:

  - Test whether the top of the application contains a fixed set of navigation links.

    - The first link must have the text `Home`.

    - The second link must have the text `About`.

    - The third link must have the text `Favorite Pokemons`.

  - Test whether the application is redirected to the home page at the `/` URL by clicking on the `Home` link in the navigation bar.

  - Test whether the application is redirected to the `About` page, at the `/about` URL, by clicking the `About` link in the navigation bar.

  - Test if the application is redirected to the `Pok√©mons Favoritados` page, in the URL `/favorites`, by clicking on the `Favorite Pok√©mon` link in the navigation bar.

  - Test whether the application is redirected to the `Not Found` page when entering an unknown URL.

    - Poked√©x should show Pok√©mon normally (without filters) when the `All` button is clicked.

    - When loading the page, the selected filter should be `All`.
